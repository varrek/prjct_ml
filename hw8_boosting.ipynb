    "- Boosting algorithms are the best for heterogeneous data.\n",
    "- Lightgbm is the fastest and usually the most accurate;\n",
    "- CatBoost doesn't need a lot of tuning;\n",
    "- CatBoost shows the best result on data with many categorical variables;\n",
    "- Always try three methods and ensemble them;\n",
    "- Remember about regularization and comparing your training score with validation;\n",
    "- Use LightGBM for experiments and in the end execute other algorithms;\n",
    "- Firstly, set default parameters, do feature engineering and then come back to parameters tuning;\n",
    "- More practice will give you more understanding and intuition;\n",
